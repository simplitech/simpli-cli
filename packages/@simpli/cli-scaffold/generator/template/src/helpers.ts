 *** THIS SCRIPT CAN BE USED AS A HELPER OR FOR BUS EVENTS ***
 * As the name suggests, this is a helper, so it is not mandatory
 * There are also other ways to use those provided methods
 * In Vue files, it is suggested to use the prototype variables (this.$var) instead helpers
 * On the other hand, use helpers in Vuex files
